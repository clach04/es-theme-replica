Replica ES Theme by dani7959

A pixel perfect theme designed from scratch for handheld devices.

Features:
- no-nonsense design;
- consistent fonts and colors throughout the UI;
- no overlapping or misaligned elements;
- good legibility at all brightness levels;
- sharp, all vector graphics;
- 4:3, 1:1 and 16:9 aspect ratios.

Install:
- press the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP";
- extract to the themes folder of your firmware.

Pro tips:
- enable clock;
- hide the help section for more screen estate and see if you like it;
- check out the color and sound options.

Trivia:
My first computer was a ZX Spectrum clone, therefore the Replica name.
The colors options are actually the four colors of the ZX Spectrum logo.
The scroll sound (you need to enable sound first) is a 1-bit ZX Spectrum capture.

Issues:
I do not own enough devices to test all aspect ratios. In fact, I only have one.
So feel free to report any issues on your device and I will do my best to fix it.

Supported systems:
I've included all systems supported by ArkOK at the time of release:
